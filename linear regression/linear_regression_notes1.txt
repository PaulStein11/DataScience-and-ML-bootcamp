Notes on ML and Data Science

1. LINEAR REGRESSION

This helps to predict data based on asking a certain question
The next step is to pull data trying to asnwer that question
The third step is going to consist in cleaning the data that we have gathered. We will find: Missing data, incomplete data, inaccurate daata, and formatting issues (headers etc). The very next thing that is added and related with cleaning is the exploration of data 
Fourth one is the explration andf visualization of data.
	- In this case we are able to start working with the data that we have collected, ex: in 	tutorial it does it exporting CSV file.
	- This manipulation is done whrough jupyter notebook and PANDAS module.
	- Framing the data, ex: getting data from columns is done with the module DataFrame inside 		PANDAS.
	- Visualization of data is done with the separate module of MATPLOT LIB
	course example: /home/paulstein/Documents/AI-ML-CV-VR
Fifth is going to be the modelgenerated by the data
Notes: For the theoretical explanation see video ref => https://appbrewery.com/courses/574672/lectures/10342714

Last one is to evaluate the model and how accurate the regresison data fits into the real case
